      Focusing on figuring out the real problem to solve is the core of my design process. From research to testing prototypes with real users, I always aim to focus on a user-centric approach through iterative design. Working collaboratively allows me to discover the most suitable principles for each project, and I'm flexible enough to adapt my design process whenever it's needed.
